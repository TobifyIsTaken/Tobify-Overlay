# Installation and Setup

1. Download the overlay using this [link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/TobifyIsTaken/Tobify-Overlay/tree/master).
2. Unzip the downloaded folder.
3. Open the folder and find the file named "Tobify.exe" - it may not show the file extension ".exe", this is fine.
4. Run the program.
5. Add your API key to the overlay:
    - On hypixel, type in the command "/api new" (this generates an API key)
    - Copy the API key.
    - Go to the settings menu by clicking on the settings icon in the top left of the window.
    - Now click on the "general" option.
    - Paste the API key in the box labeled "API Key"
6. While in the general menu, fill in your minecraft username and select the minecraft client you're using.
    - If you're using vanilla minecraft, you do not need to do anything.
    - For lunar client, uncheck the Minecraft box and check the Lunar box.
    - If your client isn't listed, tick the box named other. You will need to find your chat log.
